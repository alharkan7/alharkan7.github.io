I must confess, I only learned about Mermaid diagrams a few days ago, all thanks to Claude. I was fascinated by how Claude could answer my questions not just with text, but by seamlessly giving me illustrative diagrams directly into its responses. It was eye-opening.

I was getting curious, so I immediately dug into how Claude did this, wanting to have that same capability consistently available whenever I asked a question. What if I could always get an instant, illustrative diagram to explain an idea?

That's when the I got the idea for **Inztagram**. I decided I had to build an app that could do just that: generate instant diagrams from simple descriptions.

Here's the simple architecture of how Inztagram works:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Input] --> B{Input Type}
    B -->|Text| C[AI Processing]
    B -->|PDF| D[PDF Analysis]
    D --> C
    C --> E[Diagram Generation]
    E --> F[Mermaid.js Code]
    F --> G[Diagram Rendering]
    G --> H[Interactive Viewer]
    
    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style H fill:#c8e6c9
    style C fill:#fff3e0
```

And here's the launch ~~video~~ meme:
