Back in September, I took a small leap and signed up for a [hackathon](https://indonesiallamaevent.splashthat.com/). I’m no developer by trade, but that’s exactly why I did it.

I wanted to prove a point —that coding is no longer some exclusive skill. The truth is, it’s been a while that it’s not. Anyone can build something from scratch now.

Using Meta’s [Llama](https://www.llama.com/) LLM, I built a simple web app that turns scientific papers into flashcards; turning all the dense jargon and complex ideas from a PDF or link into bite-sized, shareable pieces of content for social media. **The goal is to help busy scientists do their [science communication](https://x.com/alhrkn/status/1461501420008394754).**

If you want to learn more about this project, I’ve laid it all out on this page:

It is a super simple app by real developers’ standards, but it’s a small testament to the idea that today the barrier of coding is non-existent.
