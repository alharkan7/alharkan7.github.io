I’m a Covid survivor.

These are some tweets from the days when I was in quarantine.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Q Day 0<br></br><br></br>I&#39;m really moved by the amount of people asking if I&#39;m alright. Even their littlest gesture, it helps a lot.<br></br><br></br>I had no expectations, I was ready to face it by myself. But here they are.<br></br><br></br>My friends might not know how grateful I am to have such great companions like them.</p>&mdash; Al (@alhrkn) <a href="https://twitter.com/alhrkn/status/1409328858763988992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 28, 2021</a></blockquote>
